# Image-Classification-using-CNN

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) is a special architecture of artificial neural networks, proposed by Yann LeCun in 1988. CNN uses some features of the visual cortex. One of the most popular uses of this architecture is image classification.

The main task of image classification is acceptance of the input image and the following definition of its class. This is a skill that people learn from their birth and are able to easily determine that the image in the picture is an elephant. 

Instead of the image, the computer sees an array of pixels. For example, if image size is 300 x 300. In this case, the size of the array will be 300x300x3(for colored image). Where 300 is width, next 300 is height and 3 is RGB channel values. The computer is assigned a value from 0 to 255 to each of these numbers. Ð¢his value describes the intensity of the pixel at each point.

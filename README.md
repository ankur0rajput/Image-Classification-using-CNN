# Image-Classification-using-CNN

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) is a special architecture of artificial neural networks, proposed by Yann LeCun in 1988. CNN uses some features of the visual cortex. One of the most popular uses of this architecture is image classification.

The main task of image classification is acceptance of the input image and the following definition of its class. This is a skill that people learn from their birth and are able to easily determine that the image in the picture is an elephant.
